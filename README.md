stockapp
========
This is a java applicaion that has two major functions first retrieving stock data from the internet and sending it throught
an homemade algorithem and saving this data. Second function is to retrieve passed save data and graph it. 

How you can help

First if you have any backround in stocks help me make a better algorithm (the one I included is very simple just to make 
program run). Second if you want to add more functions to it that would be greatly appreshated. Finaly if you want to 
improve the graphis especialy the graph graphic that would be mush appreshated. 

Notes

This project was programed using NetBeans.
Second I have not saved much data but I have been using the tag bcs for testing.
Third as of now you can only use stock tags not the whole name (ie. google is goog).
